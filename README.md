## Getting Started
Python and a few libraries are necessary to run the file. I will explain how to download the libraries later in the text.

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer
- Patience to actually read everything slowly

### Installing
[Click here](https://github.com/cjxe/skin_price_aggregator/archive/main.zip) to download **or** copy:
```
git clone https://github.com/cjxe/skin_price_aggregator
``` 
and right click on the terminal (cmd) to paste. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not forget** to install the necessary libraries.

To do that:
- If you are on **Windows**, run `runmeONCE.bat`.
- If you are on **Linux**, paste `pip install -r requirements.txt` into the terminal.

### Usage
![search_query_breakdown](https://i.ibb.co/qjRMyhf/data.png)

After **downloading Python 3.8<** and **the necessary libraries**, run `main.py` and enter a search query in the following manner:

#### 1- Define the `Category`.
| What to write | Category it searches in |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `st` | StatTrak‚Ñ¢ and ‚òÖ StatTrak‚Ñ¢ |
| `so` | Souvenir | (`/pm {username} {text}`) |
| ` ` (nothing, just search without it) | Normal and ‚òÖ | 

#### 2- Define the `Weapon`.
It can be either one-worded or two-worded, the ultimate amazing brilliant (which is actually better than valve's) search engine knows how to detect.

**Some examples:**
| What you write | Machine will correct it to |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `ak 47` | `AK-47` |
| `ak-47` | `AK-47` |
| `ak47` | `AK-47` |
| `aK-47` | `AK-47` |
| `p 2000` | `P2000` |
| `p-2000` | `P2000` |
| `P2000` | `P2000` |
...


#### 3- Define the `Skin`.
Once again, it can be either one-worded or two-worded. The the ultimate amazing brilliant (which is actually better than valve's) search engine knows how to detect.

**Some examples:**
| What you write | Machine will correct it to |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `hyperbeast` | `Hyper Beast` |
| `hyper beast` |`Hyper Beast` |
| `HyPeR BeAsT` | `Hyper Beast` |
| `ultra violet` | `Ultraviolet` |
| `ultraviolet` | `Ultraviolet` |
| `ultravi` | `Ultraviolet` |
...


#### 4- Define the `Exterior` (aka `Condition`, `Wear`).
| What to write | Exterior |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| `va` | vanilla (aka `not painted`) |
| `fn` | Factory New |
| `mw` | Minimal Wear |
| `ft` | Field-Tested |
| `ww` | Well-Worn |
| `bs` | Battle-Scarred |

#### 5- Wait and pray for no errors.

#### 6- Check out `./data/search_result.csv` for more info.
Yes.
